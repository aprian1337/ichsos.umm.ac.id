                    <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                    <div class="" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                        <p>Pandemic is a real threat to mankind because the spread of the outbreak has a wide coverage not limited only to one or two countries but almost to all countries in this world. As a threat, a pandemic has indirect implications for
                            social, economic and political conditions both at domestic and international levels. Thus, collective and comprehensive efforts are needed in responding and preventing the expansion of infections caused by the virus, including
                            Covid-19. Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 in March 2020, many countries have tried their best to prevent the spread of the virus in their countries. Nevertheless, only few has succeeded in responding this pandemic. Then
                            it tends to create new problems, for example the disruption of the social and economic order. The heterogeneous social order has resulted in a lot of premature speculation related to the Covid-19 virus, this causes many people
                            tend to ignore it.
                            <br> <br> This neglectful attitude itself is a problem within human kind due to the lack of information and knowledge, especially since the characteristics of Covid-19 are a quickly-spread type of flu. The implication for the
                            economic order is the cessation of the flow of production as well as discontinuation of goods and services transfer. It is because the virus spreads through the air, so that the fear of infection is definitely great. In addition,
                            the implementation of policies or regulations that are tentative in nature has caused political turmoil. These three implications can at least illustrate that the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the existing order. As the result,
                            the government must work hard to deal and prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus. To respond those problems, the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences and the Faculty of Economics, University of Muhammadiyah
                            Malang will hold an international conference entitled "Social and Political Issues on Sustainable Development in Post Covid-19 Crisis".This International Conference will study and discuss the social, economic as well as political
                            issues regarding the condition after the pandemic. Social issues will be studied through social welfare, sociology, governance, communication and international relations approaches. Meanwhile, economic problems through will
                            be discussed looked business, economic development and economic management approaches. Through those approaches, it is expected that the participants of the conference will be able to dissect problems, find solutions and get
                            alternative perspectives in preventing and dealing with the pandemic problems after the Covid-19.</p>

<li>Reporting Standards:<br />Authors of reports of original research should present an accurate account of the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. Underlying data should be represented accurately in the paper. A paper should contain sufficient detail and references to permit others to replicate the work. Fraudulent or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical behavior and are unacceptable.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">

</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Multiple, Redundant or Concurrent Publication:<br />An author should not, in general, publish manuscripts describing essentially the same research in more than one journal or primary publication. Submitting the same manuscript to more than one journal concurrently constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Acknowledgement of Sources:<br />Proper acknowledgment of the work of others must always be given. Authors should cite publications that have been influential in determining the nature of the reported work.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Authorship of the Paper:<br />Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study. All those who have made significant contributions should be listed as co-authors. Where there are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the research project, they should be acknowledged or listed as contributors. The corresponding author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no inappropriate co-authors are included on the paper and that all co-authors have seen and approved the final version of the paper and have agreed to its submission for publication.</li>

</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>Hazards and Human or Animal Subjects:<br />If the work involves chemicals, procedures or equipment that have any unusual hazards inherent in their use, the author must clearly identify these in the manuscript.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Duties of Editors</p>
<ol>
<li>Fair Play:<br />An editor at any time evaluates manuscripts for their intellectual content without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, or political philosophy of the authors.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Confidentiality:<br />The editor and any editorial staff must not disclose any information about a submitted manuscript to anyone other than the corresponding author, reviewers, potential reviewers, other editorial advisers, and the publisher, as appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest:<br />Unpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript must not be used in an editor's own research without the express written consent of the author.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Publication Decisions:<br />The editor board journal is responsible for deciding which of the articles submitted to the journal should be published. The validation of the work in question and its importance to researchers and readers must always drive such decisions. The editors may be guided by the policies of the journal's editorial board and constrained by such legal requirements as shall then be in force regarding libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism. The editors may confer with other editors or reviewers in making this decision.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Review of Manuscripts:<br />The editor must ensure that each manuscript is initially evaluated by the editor for originality. The editor should organize and use peer review fairly and wisely. Editors should explain their peer review processes in the information for authors and also indicate which parts of the journal are peer reviewed.

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Duties of Reviewers</p>
<ol>
<li>Contribution to Editorial Decisions:<br />Peer review assists the editor in making editorial decisions and through the editorial communications with the author may also assist the author in improving the paper.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Promptness:<br />Any selected referee who feels unqualified to review the research reported in a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be impossible should notify the editor and excuse himself from the review process</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Standards of Objectivity:<br />Reviews should be conducted objectively. Personal criticism of the author is inappropriate. Referees should express their views clearly with supporting arguments.</li>
